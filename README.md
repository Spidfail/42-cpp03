# 42-cpp03
Fourth Day of the 42's C++ learning path.

## How to use it

There is a Makefile for compiling (`make`) cleaning the project (`make clean`, `make fclean`) and rebuild it (`make re`).

## Tasks

All of these exercises are meant to help us learn inheritance in O.O.P.. The first 3 exercises make us works on basis : overrite of functions and variables, `virtual` keyword and destructors' order.   
The last exercise is an approach to a C++ particularism : diamond inheritance and the problems or solutions it can brings.
